## 🎮 **How to Use the Restored System**

### **1. Skills Extraction (Full BERT)**
```python
from bert_skills_extractor import BERTSkillsModel, SkillsExtractor

extractor = SkillsExtractor()
model = BERTSkillsModel(extractor)
model.load_model("bert_skills_model.pth", n_classes=138)

# Get advanced skill extraction with confidence scores
skills = model.predict_skills(job_description, threshold=0.3)
```

### **2. Resume Analysis (Complete LSTM)**
```python
from resume_matcher_predictor import ResumeMatcherPredictor

predictor = ResumeMatcherPredictor()
result = predictor.predict_single_match(resume_text, job_description)

# Get comprehensive analysis including:
# - Experience gap analysis
# - Project evaluation  
# - Detailed recommendations
# - Skill matching with confidence
```

### **3. Text Summarization (BERT Semantic)**
```python
from bert_summarizer import BERTSummarizerTrainer

summarizer = BERTSummarizerTrainer()
summarizer.load_model("bert_summarizer_model.pth")

# Get semantic, context-aware summaries
summary = summarizer.summarize(text, max_sentences=3)
```
